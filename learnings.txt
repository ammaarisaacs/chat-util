You can use useCallback to call a function instead of attaching useRef to an element and using a useEffect

You can keep mapping into arrays and then use the map to change the formatting of the output array for all the levels that you are iterating through

useCallback can be used to make make a fucntion that would've been called every single rerender, only be called based on the dependency you put into it
